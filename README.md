# OpticaLab

A powerful platform for simulation of Fiber Optical Communication System.

## Overview
OpticaLab aims to build an open source computer simulation platform for fiber optical communication system. Simulation wiil support high-speed, long distance, single-mode fiber transmission. Besides it will provide device modeling, fiber channel modeling, transceiver algorithm verification, component programming for system architect, link engineers, algorithm engineers and so on. OpticaLab will also optimize the computation engine with Parallel computation and GPU hardware acceleration.

## Features
